We present a probabilistic approach to block sizes in random maps,
which yields straightforward and singularity analysis-free proofs of some results of
Bender et al. (1995); Banderier et al. (2001); Gao and Wormald (1999). The proof
also yields joint convergence in distribution of the rescaled size of the k'th largest
2-connected block in a large random map, for any fixed k  2, to a vector of Frechet-
type extreme order statistics. This seems to be a new result even when k = 2.

It is shown that every adapted Brownian bridge on a geodesically complete
connected Riemannian manifold is a semimartingale including its terminal
time, without any further assumptions on the geometry. In particular, it follows
that every such process can be horizontally lifted to a smooth principal fiber bundle
with connection, including its terminal time. The proof is based on a localized
Hamilton-type gradient estimate.

Our model consists of a Brownian particle X moving in R, where a
Poissonian field of moving traps is present. Each trap is a ball with constant
radius, centered at a trap point, and each trap point moves under a Brownian
motion independently of others and of the motion of X. Here, we investigate the
`speed' of X on the time interval [0; t] and on `microscopic' time scales given that
X avoids the trap field up to time t. Firstly, following the earlier work of Athreya
et al. (2017), we obtain bounds on the maximal displacement of X from the origin.
Our upper bound is an improvement of the corresponding bound therein. Then, we
prove a result showing how the speed on microscopic time scales aect the overall
macroscopic subdiusivity on [0; t]. Finally, we show that X moves subdiusively
even on certain microscopic time scales, in the bulk of [0; t]. The results are stated
so that each gives an `optimal survival strategy' for the system. We conclude by
giving several related open problems.

This paper is a further investigation of the problem studied in Xue
(2015). We are concerned with the contact process with random vertex weights on
the oriented lattice. Our main result gives the asymptotic behavior of the survival
probability of the process conditioned on only one vertex being infected at t = 0 as
the dimension grows to infinity. A SIR model and a branching process with random
vertex weights are the main auxiliary tools for the proof of the main result.

We consider sequences of random variables living in a finite sum of
Wiener chaoses. We find necessary and sucient conditions for convergence in law
to a target variable living in the sum of the first two Wiener chaoses. Our conditions
hold notably for sequences of multiple Wiener integrals. Malliavin calculus
and in particular the -operators are used. Our results extend previous findings
by Azmoodeh et al. (2015) and are applied to central and non-central convergence
situations. Our methods are applied to investigate stable convergence and we exclude
certain classes of random variables as target variables for sequences living in
a fixed Wiener chaos.

Let r = r(n) be a sequence of integers such that r  n and let
X1; : : : ;Xr+1 be independent random points distributed according to the Gaussian,
the Beta or the spherical distribution on Rn. Limit theorems for the log-volume
and the volume of the random convex hull of X1; : : : ;Xr+1 are established in high
dimensions, that is, as r and n tend to infinity simultaneously. This includes Berry-
Esseen-type central limit theorems, log-normal limit theorems, and moderate and
large deviations. Also dierent types of mod- convergence are derived. The results
heavily depend on the asymptotic growth of r relative to n. For example, we
prove that the 
uctuations of the volume of the simplex are normal (respectively,
log-normal) if r = o(n) (respectively, r n for some 0 < < 1).

We introduce a family of real random variables (fi; ) arising from the
supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model H2j2 and containing the family fi introduced
by Sabot, Tarres, and Zeng (Sabot et al., 2017) in the context of the vertexreinforced
jump process. Using this family we construct an exponential martingale
generalizing the ones considered in Sabot and Zeng (2018+) and Disertori et al.
(2017). Moreover, using the full supersymmetric nonlinear sigma model we also
construct a generalization of the exponential martingale involving Grassmann variables.

We investigate a probabilistic model for routeing of messages in relayaugmented
multihop ad-hoc networks, where each transmitter sends one message
to the origin. Given the (random) transmitter locations, we weight the family of
random, uniformly distributed message trajectories by an exponential probability
weight, favouring trajectories with low interference (measured in terms of signal-tointerference
ratio) and trajectory families with little congestion (measured in terms
of the number of pairs of hops using the same relay). Under the resulting Gibbs
measure, the system targets the best compromise between entropy, interference
and congestion for a common welfare, instead of an optimization of the individual
trajectories.
In the limit of high spatial density of users, we describe the totality of all the
message trajectories in terms of empirical measures. Employing large deviations
arguments, we derive a characteristic variational formula for the limiting free energy
and analyse the minimizer(s) of the formula, which describe the most likely shapes
of the trajectory 
ow. The empirical measures of the message trajectories well
describe the interference, but not the congestion; the latter requires introducing
an additional empirical measure. Our results remain valid under replacing the two
penalization terms by more general functionals of these two empirical measures.

The purpose of this paper is to present Bernstein and Hoeding type inequalities
for regenerative Markov chains. Furthermore, we generalize these results
and establish exponential bounds for suprema of empirical processes over a class of
functions F which size is controlled by its uniform entropy number. All constants
involved in the bounds of the considered inequalities are given in an explicit form
which can be advantageous for practical considerations. We present the theory for
regenerative Markov chains, however the inequalities are also valid in the Harris
recurrent case.

We consider connectivity properties of the Branching Interlacements
model in Zd; d  5, recently introduced by Angel, Rath and Zhu (Angel et al.,
2019). Using stochastic dimension techniques we show that every two vertices
visited by the branching interlacements are connected via at most dd=4e conditioned
critical branching random walks from the underlying Poisson process, and that
this upper bound is sharp. In particular every such two branching random walks
intersect if and only if 5  d  8. The stochastic dimension of branching random
walk result is of independent interest. We additionally obtain heat kernel bounds
for branching random walks conditioned on survival.

Lévy-type perpetuities being the a.s. limits of particular generalized
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes are a natural continuous-time generalization of discrete-
time perpetuities. These are random variables of the form S :=
R
[0;1) eXsdZs,
where (X;Z) is a two-dimensional Lévy process, and Z is a drift-free Lévy process
of bounded variation. We prove an ultimate criterion for the finiteness of power
moments of S. This result and the previously known assertion due to Erickson
and Maller (2005) concerning the a.s. finiteness of S are then used to derive ultimate
necessary and sufficient conditions for the Lp-convergence for p > 1 and
p = 1, respectively, of Biggins’ martingales associated to branching Lévy processes.
In particular, we provide final versions of results obtained recently in Bertoin and
Mallein (2018).

We study random unrooted plane trees with n vertices sampled according
to the weights corresponding to the vertex-degrees. Our main result shows that
if the generating series of the weights has positive radius of convergence, then this
model of random trees may be approximated geometrically by a Galton{Watson
tree conditioned on having a large random size. This implies that a variety of
results for the well-studied planted case also hold for unrooted trees, including
Gromov{Hausdor{Prokhorov scaling limits, tail-bounds for the diameter, distributional
graph limits, and limits for the maximum degree. Our work complements
results by Wang (2016), who studied random unrooted plane trees whose diameter
tends to infinity.

We consider a gas of independent Brownian particles on a bounded interval
in contact with two particle reservoirs at the endpoints. Due to the Brownian
nature of the particles, infinitely many particles enter and leave the system in each
time interval. Nonetheless, the dynamics can be constructed as a Markov process
with continuous paths on a suitable state space. If 0 and 1 are the chemical
potentials of the boundary reservoirs, the stationary distribution (reversible if and
only if 0 = 1) is a Poisson point process with intensity given by the linear interpolation
between 0 and 1. We then analyze the empirical 
ow that it is defined
by counting, in a time interval [0; t], the net number of particles crossing a given
point x. In the stationary regime we identify its statistics and show that it is given,
apart an x dependent correction that is bounded for large t, by the dierence of
two independent Poisson processes with parameters 0 and 1.

The present paper is devoted to the study of a McKean-Vlasov diu-
sion oftype self-stabilizing. We obtain this model by taking the hydrodynamical
limit of a mean-field system of particles. The main question that we study is the
exit-time. We take a confining potential with two wells : a < 0 and b > 0. We
start with a deterministic condition x0 > 0 and we show that the first time that
this diusion leaves an interval of the form (d;+1) (d verifying some assumptions)
satisfies a Kramers'type law. In other words, this time is exponentially equivalent
to exp
 2
2H
	
as the diusion coecient  goes to 0, H being the exit cost. Inci-
dentally, we also prove that the solution of the granular media equation is trapped
(for the 2-Wasserstein distance) in a ball centered around b during a time at least
exponentially equivalent to exp
 2

This paper studies a variant of the multi-type contact process as a
model for the competition between cooperators and defectors. Regardless of their
type, individuals die at rate one. Defectors give birth at a fixed rate whereas cooperators
give birth at a rate that increases linearly with the number of nearby cooperators.
In particular, it is assumed that only cooperators benefit from cooperators,
which is referred to as kin-recognition in the ecological literature. To understand
how the inclusion of space in the form of local interactions affects the dynamics,
the results for the interacting particle system are compared with their counterpart
for the non-spatial mean-field model. Due to some monotonicity with respect to
the parameters, both the spatial and non-spatial models exhibit a unique phase
transition. Our analysis shows however a major difference: In the spatial model,
when cooperation is strong enough, the cooperators out-compete the defectors even
when starting at arbitrarily low density. In contrast, regardless of the strength of
cooperation, when the initial density of cooperators is too low, the defectors outcompete
the cooperators in the non-spatial model. In particular, when cooperation
is sufficiently strong, the cooperators can invade the defectors in their equilibrium in
the spatial model but not in the non-spatial model, showing that space in the form
of local interactions promotes cooperation. This result is consistent with previous
results in the literature of interacting particle systems, but our work also shows
an interesting novel aspect: in contrast with the inclusion of local interactions, the
inclusion of spontaneous deaths promotes defection.

Suppose that on the square lattice the edge with midpoint x becomes
open at rate kxk
1 . Let (x; t) be the probability that the corresponding edge
is open at time t and let n(p; t) be the distance at which edges are open with
probability p at time t. We show that with probability tending to 1 as t ! 1:
(i) the open cluster containing the origin C0(t) is contained in the square of radius
n(pc; t), and (ii) the cluster fills the square of radius n(pc+; t) with the density
of points near x being close to ((x; t)) where (p) is the percolation probability
when bonds are open with probability p on Z2. Results of Nolin suggest that if
N = n(pc; t) then the boundary 
uctuations of C0(t) are of size N4=7.

It is well-known that the transition function of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process solves the Fokker-Planck equation. This standard setting has been recently
generalized in different directions, for example, by considering the so-called
-stable driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, or by time-changing the original process with
an inverse stable subordinator. In both cases, the corresponding partial differential
equations involve fractional derivatives (of Riesz and Riemann-Liouville types, respectively)
and the solution is not Gaussian. We consider here a new model, which
cannot be expressed by a random time-change of the original process: we start by
a Fokker-Planck equation (in Fourier space) with the time-derivative replaced by
a new fractional differential operator. The resulting process is Gaussian and, in
the stationary case, exhibits long-range dependence. Moreover, we consider further
extensions, by means of the so-called convolution-type derivative.

We consider random graphs with uniformly bounded edges on a Poisson
point process conditioned to contain the origin. In particular we focus on the
random connection model, the Boolean model and the Miller{Abrahams random
resistor network with lower{bounded conductances. The latter is relevant for the
analysis of conductivity by Mott variable range hopping in strongly disordered
systems. By using the method of randomized algorithms developed by Duminil{
Copin et al. we prove that in the subcritical phase the probability that the origin
is connected to some point at distance n decays exponentially in n, while in the
supercritical phase the probability that the origin is connected to infinity is strictly
positive and bounded from below by a term proportional to (  c),  being the
density of the Poisson point process and c being the critical density.

We prove a Berry–Esseen type inequality for approximating expectations
of sufficiently smooth functions f, like f = j  j3, with respect to standardized
convolutions of laws P1; : : : ; Pn on the real line by corresponding expectations based
on symmetric two-point laws Q1; : : : ;Qn isoscedastic to the Pi. Equality is attained
for every possible constellation of the Lipschitz constant kf00kL and the variances
and the third centred absolute moments of the Pi. The error bound is strictly
smaller than 1
6 times the Lyapunov ratio times kf00kL, and tends to zero also if n
is fixed and the third standardized absolute moments of the Pi tend to one.
In the homoscedastic case of equal variances of the Pi, and hence in particular
in the i.i.d. case, the approximating law is a standardized symmetric binomial one.
The inequality is strong enough to yield for some constellations, in particular in
the i.i.d. case with n large enough given the standardized third absolute moment
of P1, an improvement of a more classical and already optimal Berry–Esseen type
inequality of Tyurin (2009).
Auxiliary results presented include some inequalities either purely analytical or
concerning Zolotarev’s -metrics, and some binomial moment calculations.

Using probabilistic methods we study the existence of viscosity solutions
to non-linear integro-dierential equations
with initial condition u(0; x) = '(x); here (b(x);Q(x); (x; dy)),  2 I, x 2 Rd,
is a family of Levy triplets and h is some truncation function. The solutions, which
we construct, are of the form u(t; x) = Tt'(x) for a sublinear Markov semigroup
(Tt)t0 with representation
Tt'(x) = Ex'(Xt) := sup
P2Px
Z


'(Xt) dP
where (Xt)t0 is a stochastic process and Px, x 2 Rd, are families of probability
measures. The key idea is to exploit the connection between sublinear Markov
semigroups and the associated Kolmogorov backward equation. In particular, we
obtain new existence and uniqueness results for viscosity solutions to Kolmogorov
backward equations associated with Levy(-type) processes for sublinear expectations
and Feller processes on classical probability spaces.

Tree-structured data naturally appear in various fields, particularly in
biology where plants and blood vessels may be described by trees, but also in
computer science because XML documents form a tree structure. This paper is
devoted to the estimation of the relative scale parameter of conditioned Galton-
Watson trees. New estimators are introduced and their consistency is stated. A
comparison is made with an existing approach of the literature. A simulation study
shows the good behavior of our procedure on finite-sample sizes and from missing
or noisy data. An application to the analysis of revisions of Wikipedia articles is
also considered through real data.

We introduce a two-dimensional, distribution-valued field, which we
call the quadratic field, associated with the one-dimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process and we prove that the stationary quadratic fluctuations of the simple exclusion
process, in the diffusive scaling, converge to this quadratic field. Moreover,
we prove that this quadratic field evaluated at the diagonal corresponds to the
Wick-renormalized square of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and we use this new
representation in order to prove some small and large-time properties of it.

We study rates of convergence in central limit theorems for the partial
sum of squares of general Gaussian sequences, using tools from analysis on Wiener
space. No assumption of stationarity, asymptotically or otherwise, is made. The
main theoretical tool is the so-called Optimal Fourth Moment Theorem (Nourdin
and Peccati, 2015), which provides a sharp quantitative estimate of the total variation
distance on Wiener chaos to the normal law. The only assumptions made
on the sequence are the existence of an asymptotic variance, that a least-squarestype
estimator for this variance parameter has a bias and a variance which can be
controlled, and that the sequence’s auto-correlation function, which may exhibit
long memory, has a no-worse memory than that of fractional Brownian motion
with Hurst parameter H < 3=4. Our main result is explicit, exhibiting the tradeoff
between bias, variance, and memory. We apply our result to study drift parameter
estimation problems for subfractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and bifractional
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with fixed-time-step observations. These are processes
which fail to be stationary or self-similar, but for which detailed calculations
result in explicit formulas for the estimators’ asymptotic normality.

This article studies the dynamics of a nonlinear dissipative reactiondiffusion
equation with well-separated stable states which is perturbed by infinitedimensional
multiplicative Lévy noise with a regularly varying component at intensity
 > 0. The main results establish the precise asymptotics of the first exit times
and locus of the solution X from the domain of attraction of a deterministic stable
state, in the limit as  ! 0. In contrast to the exponential growth for respective
Gaussian perturbations the exit times grow essentially as a power function of the
noise intensity as  ! 0 with the exponent given as the tail index ,  > 0;
of the Lévy measure, analogously to the case of additive noise in Debussche et al.
(2013). In this article we substantially improve their quadratic estimate of the small
jump dynamics and derive a new exponential estimate of the stochastic convolution
for stochastic Lévy integrals with bounded jumps based on the recent pathwise
Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality by Siorpaes (2018). This allows to cover perturbations
with general tail index  > 0, multiplicative noise and perturbations of
the linear heat equation. In addition, our convergence results are probabilistically
strongest possible. Finally, we infer the metastable convergence of the process on
the common time scale t= to a Markov chain switching between the stable states
of the deterministic dynamical system.

This paper aims at comparing theoretical approximations of the tail
of the maximum of stochastic processes and the corresponding numerical evaluations.
More particularly, we focus on the Pickands or double sum method, the Rice
method, the Euler Characteristic method and a new one called the Poisson method.
The numerical evaluation, performed using mainly Quasi Monte-Carlo integration
and adaptations of the programs of Genz, show the domains of validity of each
method.

We study functional convergence of sums of moving averages with random
coefficients and heavy-tailed innovations. Under some standard moment conditions
and the assumption that all partial sums of the series of coefficients are
a.s. bounded between zero and the sum of the series we obtain functional convergence
of the corresponding partial sum stochastic process in the space D[0; 1] of
càdlàg functions with the Skorohod M2 topology.

We study random typical minimal factorizations of the n-cycle, which
are factorizations of (1; : : : ; n) as a product of n1 transpositions, chosen uniformly
at random. Our main result is, roughly speaking, a local convergence theorem
for the trajectories of finitely many points in the factorization. The main tool
is an encoding of the factorization by an edge and vertex-labelled tree, which is
shown to converge to Kesten’s infinite Bienaymé-Galton-Watson tree with Poisson
offspring distribution, uniform i.i.d. edge labels and vertex labels obtained by a
local exploration algorithm.

We provide a process on the space of collections of coalescing cadlag
stable paths and show convergence in an appropriate topology for coalescing stable
random walks on the integer lattice.

We present an elementary approach to the order of fluctuations for the
free energy in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick mean field spin glass model at and near
the critical temperature. It is proved that at the critical temperature the variance
of the free energy is of O((logN)2): In addition, we show that if one approaches
the critical temperature from the low temperature regime at the rate O(N) for
some  > 0; then the variance is of O((logN)2 + N1):

We prove local limit theorems for mod-ϕ convergent sequences of ran-
dom variables, ϕ being a stable distribution. In particular, we give two new proofs
of the local limit theorem stated in Delbaen et al. (2015): one proof based on the
notion of zone of control introduced in Féray et al. (2019+a), and one proof based
on the notion of mod-ϕ convergence in L1(iR). These new approaches allow us
to identify the infinitesimal scales at which the stable approximation is valid. We
complete our analysis with a large variety of examples to which our results ap-
ply, and which stem from random matrix theory, number theory, combinatorics or
statistical mechanics.

Herein, we describe multidimensional Brownian motions for d = 2; 3
with drifts whose order is the same as that of the mean displacement of a Brownian
motion. We consider the probabilities that the processes remain in specific cones for
a considerable amount of time. We obtain exponents expressing the probabilities,
which are different from that of the ordinary Brownian motion. Finally, we suggest
an open problem concerning the exact values.

We study the asymptotic edge statistics of the Gaussian fi-ensemble,
a collection of n particles, as the inverse temperature fi tends to zero as n tends
to infinity. In a certain decay regime of fi, the associated extreme point process is
proved to converge in distribution to a Poisson point process as n ! +1. We also
extend a well known result on Poisson limit for Gaussian extremes by showing the
existence of an edge regime that we did not find in the literature

In this paper, we initiate the study of “Generalized Divide and Color
Models”. A very interesting special case of this is the “Divide and Color Model”
(which motivates the name we use) introduced and studied by Olle Häggström.
In this generalized model, one starts with a finite or countable set V , a random
partition of V and a parameter p 2 [0; 1]. The corresponding Generalized Divide
and Color Model is the f0; 1g-valued process indexed by V obtained by independently,
for each partition element in the random partition chosen, with probability
p, assigning all the elements of the partition element the value 1, and with probability
1  p, assigning all the elements of the partition element the value 0.
Some of the questions which we study here are the following. Under what situations
can different random partitions give rise to the same color process? What
can one say concerning exchangeable random partitions? What is the set of product
measures that a color process stochastically dominates? For random partitions
which are translation invariant, what ergodic properties do the resulting color processes
have?
The motivation for studying these processes is twofold; on the one hand, we
believe that this is a very natural and interesting class of processes that deserves
investigation and on the other hand, a number of quite varied well-studied processes
actually fall into this class such as (1) the Ising model, (2) the fuzzy Potts model,
(3) the stationary distributions for the Voter Model, (4) random walk in random
scenery and of course (5) the original Divide and Color Model.

We consider the Kawasaki dynamics of two types of particles under
a killing effect on a d-dimensional square lattice. Particles move with possibly
different jump rates depending on their types. The killing effect acts when particles
of different types meet at the same site. We show the existence of a limit under
the diffusive space-time scaling and suitably growing killing rate: segregation of
distinct types of particles does occur, and the evolution of the interface between
the two distinct species is governed by the two-phase Stefan problem. We apply
the relative entropy method and combine it with some PDE techniques.

The concept of a Lévy subordinator is generalized to a family of nondecreasing
stochastic processes, which are parameterized in terms of two Bernstein
functions. Whereas the independent increments property is only maintained in the
Lévy subordinator special case, the considered family is always strongly infinitely
divisible with respect to time, meaning that a path can be represented in distribution
as a finite sum with arbitrarily many summands of independent and identically
distributed paths of another process. Besides distributional properties of the process,
we present two applications to the design of accurate and efficient simulation
algorithms. First, each member of the considered family corresponds uniquely to
an exchangeable max-stable sequence of random variables, and we demonstrate
how the associated extreme-value copula can be simulated exactly and efficiently
from its Pickands dependence measure. Second, we show how one obtains different
series and integral representations for infinitely divisible probability laws by
varying the parameterizing pair of Bernstein functions, without changing the law
of one-dimensional margins of the process. As a particular example, we present an
exact simulation algorithm for compound Poisson distributions from the Bondesson
class, for which the generalized inverse of the distribution function of the associated
Stieltjes measure can be evaluated accurately.

We consider the Brownian interlacements model in Euclidean space,
introduced by Sznitman (2013). We give estimates for the asymptotics of the visibility
in the vacant set. We also consider visibility inside the vacant set of the
Brownian excursion process in the unit disc and show that it undergoes a phase
transition regarding visibility to infinity as in Benjamini et al. (2009). Additionally,
we determine the critical value and that there is no visibility to infinity at the
critical intensity.

We consider the backbone of the infinite cluster generated by supercritical
oriented site percolation in dimension 1  1. A directed random walk on
this backbone can be seen as an “ancestral lineage” of an individual sampled in
the stationary discrete-time contact process. Such ancestral lineages were investigated
in Birkner et al. (2013) where a central limit theorem for a single walker was
proved. Here, we consider infinitely many coalescing walkers on the same backbone
starting at each space-time point. We show that, after diffusive rescaling, the collection
of paths converges in distribution (under the averaged law) to the Brownian
web. Hence, we prove convergence to the Brownian web for a particular system of
coalescing random walks in a dynamical random environment. An important tool
in the proof is a tail bound on the meeting time of two walkers on the backbone,
started at the same time. Our result can be interpreted as an averaging statement
about the percolation cluster: apart from a change of variance, it behaves as the
full lattice, i.e. the effect of the “holes” in the cluster vanishes on a large scale.

Probability measures and stochastic dynamics on matrices and on partitions
are related by standard, albeit technical, discrete to continuous scaling limits.
In this paper we provide exact relations, that go in both directions, between the
eigenvalues of the Laguerre process and certain distinguished dynamics on partitions.
This is done by generalizing to the multidimensional setting recent results of
Miclo and Patie on linear one-dimensional diffusions and birth and death chains.
As a corollary, we obtain an exact relation between the Laguerre and Meixner ensembles.
Finally, we explain the deep connections with the Young bouquet and the
z-measures on partitions.

We consider a version of ballistic annihilation with particles placed at
the integer points on the real line. Each is independently assigned either speed-
0 with probability p, or speed-1 symmetrically with the remaining probability.
All particles simultaneously begin moving at their assigned speeds and mutually
annihilate upon colliding. A renewal property lets us equate survival of a particle
to the survival of a Galton-Watson process. An immediate application of our result
is an upper bound for the critical probability when particles have unit spacings.
This comes from a rigorous, computer-assisted approximation of the Galton-Watson
process offspring distribution.

We analyze the metastable behavior near criticality for bootstrap
percolation on Galton-Watson trees. We find that, depending on the exact choice
of the offspring distribution, it is possible to have several distinct metastable states,
with varying scaling of their duration while approaching criticality.

We present a Gaussian process that arises from the iteration of p fractional
Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes generated by the same fractional Brownian
motion. When the values of the parameters defining the iteration are pairwise
distinct, this iteration results in a particular linear combination of those processes.
Although for H > 1=2 each term of the iteration is a long memory process, we prove
that when p  2 the process obtained has short memory. We prove that the local
Hölder index of the process is H, and obtain an explicit formula for the spectral
density. We present a way to estimate the parameters and prove that the estimators
are consistent and the results are asymptotically Gaussian. These processes can be
used to model time series of long or short memory.

Herein, we present a study on frequently visited sets in a simple random
walk in Z2. We estimate the expectation of numbers of j-tuples of favorite points
and obtain an exact exponent.

We consider a variant of the continuous and discrete Ulam-Hammersley
problems: we study the maximal number of points of an increasing path through a
Poisson point process (or a Bernoulli point process) with the restriction that there
must be minimal gaps between abscissae and ordinates of successive points of the
path.
For both cases (continuous and discrete) our approach rely on couplings with
well-studied models: respectively the classical Ulam-Hammersley problem and last-
passage percolation with geometric weights. Thanks to these couplings we obtain
explicit limiting shapes in both settings. We also establish that, as in the classical
Ulam-Hammersley problem, the fluctuations around the mean are given by the
Tracy-Widom distribution.

In this paper we deal with the classical problem of random cover times.
We investigate the distribution of the time it takes for a Poisson process of cylinders
to cover a set A  Rd: This Poisson process of cylinders is invariant under rotations,
reflections and translations, and in addition we add a time component so that
cylinders are “raining from the sky" at unit rate. Our main results concerns the
asymptotic of this cover time as the set A grows. If the set A is discrete and well
separated, we show convergence of the cover time to a Gumbel distribution. If
instead A has positive box dimension (and satisfies a weak additional assumption),
we find the correct rate of convergence.

In Salminen et al. (2015), Salminen, Yen and Yor have proven several
equalities of sigma-finite measures involving the law of one-dimensional recurrent
diffusions and some of its h-transforms. In the present article, we show that similar
equalities hold in the setting of irreducible and recurrent discrete Markov chains.

We study the asymptotic properties of nearest-neighbor random walks
in 1d random environment under the influence of an external field of intensity
 2 R. For ergodic shift-invariant environments, we show that the limiting velocity
v() is always increasing and that it is everywhere analytic except at most in two
points  and +. When  and + are distinct, v() might fail to be continuous.
We refine the assumptions in Zeitouni (2004) for having a recentered CLT with
diffusivity 2() and give explicit conditions for 2() to be analytic. For the
random conductance model we show that, in contrast with the deterministic case,
2() is not monotone on the positive (resp. negative) half-line and that it is not
differentiable at  = 0. For this model we also prove the Einstein Relation, both in
discrete and continuous time, extending the result of Lam and Depauw (2016).

In this paper, we prove convergence in distribution of Langevin processes
in the overdamped asymptotics. The proof relies on the classical perturbed
test function (or corrector) method, which is used both to show tightness in path
space, and to identify the extracted limit with a martingale problem. The result
holds assuming the continuity of the gradient of the potential energy, and a mild
control of the initial kinetic energy.

We investigate the problem of constructing a dynamics on edge–spin
configurations which realizes a coupling between a Glauber dynamics of the Ising
model and a dynamical evolution of the percolation configurations. We dreamed of
constructing a Markov process on edge–spin configurations which is reversible with
respect to the Ising–FK coupling measure, and such that the marginal on the spins
is a Glauber dynamics, while the marginal on the edges is a Markovian evolution.
We present two local dynamics, one which fulfills only the first condition and one
which fulfills the first two conditions. We show next that our dream process is not
feasible in general. We present a third dynamics, which is non local and fulfills the
first and the third conditions. We finally present a localized version of this third
dynamics, which can be seen as a contraction of the first dynamics.

We study the spatial Gibbs random graphs introduced in Mourrat and
Valesin (2018) from the point of view of local convergence. These are random
graphs embedded in an ambient space consisting of a line segment, defined through
a probability measure that favors graphs of small (graph-theoretic) diameter but
penalizes the presence of edges whose extremities are distant in the geometry of the
ambient space. In Mourrat and Valesin (2018) these graphs were shown to exhibit
threshold behavior with respect to the various parameters that define them; this
behavior was related to the formation of hierarchical structures of edges organized
so as to produce a small diameter. Here we prove that, for certain values of the
underlying parameters, the spatial Gibbs graphs may or may not converge locally,
in a manner that is compatible with the aforementioned hierarchical structures.

We consider random permutation matrices following a one-parameter
family of deformations of the uniform distribution, called Ewens’ measures, and
modifications of these matrices where the entries equal to one are replaced by i.i.d
uniform random variables on the unit circle. For each of these two ensembles of
matrices, rescaling properly the eigenangles provides a limiting point process as
the size of the matrices goes to infinity. If J is an interval of R, we show that, as
the length of J tends to infinity, the number of points lying in J of the limiting
point process related to modified permutation matrices is asymptotically normal.
Moreover, for permutation matrices without modification, if a and a + b denote
the endpoints of J, we still have an asymptotic normality for the number of points
lying in J, in the two following cases: [a fixed and b ! 1] and [a; b ! 1 with b
proportional to a].

Nourdin and Peccati (2009a) established a neat characterization of
Gamma approximation on a fixed Wiener chaos in terms of convergence of only
the third and fourth cumulants. In this paper, we provide an optimal rate of
convergence in the d2-distance in terms of the maximum of the third and fourth
cumulants analogous to the result for normal approximation in Nourdin and Peccati
(2015). In order to achieve our goal, we introduce a novel operator theory approach
to Stein’s method. The recent development in Stein’s method for the Gamma distribution
of Döbler and Peccati (2018) plays a pivotal role in our analysis. Several
examples in the context of quadratic forms are considered to illustrate our optimal
bound.

In a companion article we have introduced a notion of multiscale functional
inequalities for functions X(A) of an ergodic stationary random field A on
the ambient space Rd. These inequalities are multiscale weighted versions of standard
Poincaré, covariance, and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. They hold for all
the examples of fields A arising in the modelling of heterogeneous materials in the
applied sciences whereas their standard versions are much more restrictive. In this
contribution we first investigate the link between multiscale functional inequalities
and more standard decorrelation or mixing properties of random fields. Next,
we show that multiscale functional inequalities imply fine concentration properties
for nonlinear functions X(A). This constitutes the main stochastic ingredient to
the quenched large-scale regularity theory for random elliptic operators by the second
author, Neukamm, and Otto, and to the corresponding quantitative stochastic
homogenization results.

The key to our investigation is an improved (and in a sense sharp)
understanding of the survival time of the contact process on star graphs. Using these
results, we show that for the contact process on Galton-Watson trees, when the
offspring distribution (i) is subexponential the critical value for local survival 2 = 0
and (ii) when it is geometric(p) we have 2  Cp, where the Cp are much smaller
than previous estimates. We also study the critical value c(n) for “prolonged
persistence” on graphs with n vertices generated by the configuration model. In the
case of power law and stretched exponential distributions where it is known c(n) !
0 we give estimates on the rate of convergence. Physicists tell us that c(n) 
1=(n) where (n) is the maximum eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. Our results
show that this is accurate for graphs with power-law degree distributions, but not
for stretched exponentials.

We introduce a definition of delayed and rushed processes in terms
of lifetimes of base processes and time-changed base processes. Then, we consider
time changes given by subordinators and their inverse processes. Our analysis shows
that, quite surprisingly, time-changing with inverse subordinators does not necessarily
imply delay of the base process. Moreover, time-changing with subordinators
does not necessarily imply rushed base process.

Let d  2. We consider an i.i.d. supercritical bond percolation on Zd,
every edge is open with a probability p > pc(d), where pc(d) denotes the critical
point. We condition on the event that 0 belongs to the infinite cluster C1 and we
consider connected subgraphs of C1 having at most nd vertices and containing 0.
Among these subgraphs, we are interested in the ones that minimize the open
edge boundary size to volume ratio. These minimizers properly rescaled converge
towards a translate of a deterministic shape and their open edge boundary size to
volume ratio properly rescaled converges towards a deterministic constant.

Following recently discovered connections between Boolean cumulants
and freeness, we use them to derive explicit formulas for a family of conditional expectations
in free variables. Further, we show how the approach through Boolean
cumulants together with subordination simplifies some Lukacs–type regression characterizations
in free probability. Finally, we explain how the free dual Lukacs property
can be used to get a pocket proof of the free version of the direct Lukacs
property.

We study the signal-to-interference ratio (SINR) percolation model for
a stationary Cox point process in two or higher dimensions, in case of a bounded and
integrable path-loss function. We show that if this function has compact support
or if the stationary intensity measure evaluated at a unit box has some exponential
moments, then the SINR graph has an infinite connected component in case the
spatial density of points is large enough and the interferences are sufficiently reduced
(without vanishing). This holds under suitable stabilization and connectivity
assumptions on the intensity measure. We also provide estimates on the critical
interference cancellation factor.

Given a large matrix containing independent data entries, we consider
the problem of detecting a submatrix inside the data matrix that contains largerthan-
usual values. Different from previous literature, we do not have exact information
about the dimension of the potential elevated submatrix. We propose a
Bonferroni type testing procedure based on permutation tests, and show that our
proposed test loses no first-order asymptotic power compared to tests with full
knowledge of potential elevated submatrix. In order to speed up the calculation
during the test, an approximation net is constructed and we show that Bonferroni
type permutation test on the approximation net loses no power on the first order
asymptotically.

Let d be an integer greater or equal to 2 and let k be a d-dimensional
random vector. We call Gaussian wave model with random wavevector k any
stationary Gaussian random field defined on Rd with covariance function t 7!
E[cos(k:t)]. Any stationary Gaussian random field on Rd can be studied as a
random wave. The purpose of the present paper is to link properties of the random
wave with the distribution of the random wavevector, with a focus on geometric
properties. We mainly concentrate on the study of the level sets measure, giving
for instance a local estimate of its variance. In the planar case, we prove that the
expected length of the nodal lines is decreasing as the anisotropy of the wavevector
is increasing, and we study the direction that maximizes the expected length of
the crest lines. We illustrate our results on two specific models: a generalization of
Berry’s monochromatic planar waves and a spatiotemporal sea wave model whose
random wavevector is supported by the Airy surface in R3. According to a general
theorem, these two Gaussian fields are anisotropic almost sure solutions of partial
differential equations that involve the Laplacian operator: f + 2f = 0 (where
 = kkk) for the former, f + @4
t f = 0 for the latter.

In this paper, we first show that for a countable family of random
elements taking values in a partially ordered Polish space with a closed partial order
(POP space), association (both positive and negative) of all finite dimensional
marginals implies that of the infinite sequence. Our proof proceeds via Strassen’s
theorem for stochastic domination and thus avoids the assumption of normally ordered
on the product space as needed for positive association in Lindqvist (1988).
We use these results to show on POP spaces that finite dimensional negative association
implies negative association of the random measure and negative association
is preserved under weak convergence of random measures. The former provides a
simpler proof in the most general setting of Polish spaces complementing the recent
proofs in Poinas et al. (2019) and Lyons (2014) which restrict to point processes in
Rd and locally compact Polish spaces respectively. We also provide some examples
of associated random measures which shall illustrate our results as well.

We introduce a continuous-time Markov chain describing dynamic allelic
partitions which extends the branching process construction of the Pitman
sampling formula in Pitman (2006) and the classical birth-and-death process with
immigration of Karlin and McGregor (1967), in turn related to the celebrated Ewens
sampling formula. A biological basis for the scheme is provided in terms of a population
of individuals grouped into families, that evolves according to a sequence of
births, deaths and immigrations. We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the
chain and show that, as opposed to the birth-and-death process with immigration,
this construction maintains in the temporal limit the mutual dependence among the
multiplicities. When the death rate exceeds the birth rate the system is shown to
have a reversible distribution, identified as a mixture of Pitman sampling formulae,
with negative binomial mixing distribution on the population size. The population
therefore converges to a stationary random configuration, characterised by a finite
number of families and individuals.

Let (T;X) be independent identically distributed pairs of random variables
and denote f (tjx) the conditional density of T given X = x, we consider
that the random variable T is subject to random censoring by another random
variable C. In this paper, we propose and investigate an adaptive recursive kernel
conditional density estimation under censored data, which allows us to circumvent
the weak performances of Kaplan-Meier estimator (Kaplan and Meier, 1958) in the
right-tail of the distribution. The first aim of this paper is to study the properties of
the proposed adaptive recursive estimators and compare it with the non-recursive
estimator of f (tjx). It turns out that, with an adequate selected bandwidth and
a special stepsize, the proposed recursive estimators often provides better results
compared to the non-recursive one in terms of estimation error and much better
in terms of computational costs. We corroborated these theoretical results through
some simulation study.

We consider the additive model: Z = X + "; where X and " are independent.
We construct a new estimator of the density of X from n observations
of Z. We propose a projection method which exploits the specific properties of
the Hermite basis. We study the quality of the resulting estimator by proving a
bound on the integrated quadratic risk. We show also that the results can be easily
extended to dependent variables. We then propose an adaptive estimation procedure,
that is a method of selecting a relevant model. We check that our estimator
reaches the classical convergence speeds of deconvolution. Numerical simulations
are proposed and a comparison with the results of the method proposed in Comte
and Lacour (2011) is performed.

We consider non-linear evolution equations arising from mean-field limits
of particle systems on discrete spaces. We investigate a notion of curvature bounds
for these dynamics based on the convexity of the free energy along interpolations
in a discrete transportation distance related to the gradient flow structure of the
dynamics. This notion extends the one for linear Markov chain dynamics studied
in Erbar and Maas (2012). We show that positive curvature bounds entail several
functional inequalities controlling the convergence to equilibrium of the dynamics.
We establish explicit curvature bounds for several examples of mean-field limits of
various classical models from statistical mechanics.

This paper concerns the long term behaviour of a growth model describing
a random sequential allocation of particles on a finite graph. The probability of
allocating a particle at a vertex is proportional to a log-linear function of numbers of
existing particles in a neighbourhood of a vertex. When this function depends only
on the number of particles in the vertex, the model becomes a special case of the
generalised Pólya urn model. In this special case all but finitely many particles are
allocated at a single random vertex almost surely. In our model interaction leads
to the fact that, with probability one, all but finitely many particles are allocated
at vertices of a maximal clique.

The persistent walk is a classical model in kinetic theory, which has
also been studied as a toy model for Markov Chain Monte Carlo questions. Its continuous
limit, the telegraph process, has recently been extended to various velocity
jump processes (Bouncy Particle Sampler, Zig-Zag process, etc.) in order to sample
general target distributions on Rd. This paper studies, from a sampling point of
view, general kinetic walks that are natural discrete-time (and possibly discretespace)
counterparts of these continuous-space processes. The main contributions
of the paper are the definition and study of a discrete-space Zig-Zag sampler and
the definition and time-discretisation of hybrid jump/diffusion kinetic samplers for
multi-scale potentials on Rd.

In this paper we study anisotropic oriented percolation on Zd for d  4
and show that the local condition for phase transition is closely related to the meanfield
condition. More precisely, we show that if the sum of the local probabilities
is strictly greater than one and each probability is not too large, then percolation
occurs.

In this paper, we develop the theory of nonlinear rough paths. Following
the ideas of Lyons and Gubinelli, we define the nonlinear rough integral
R t
s W(dr; Yr), where W and Y are only -Hölder continuous in time with 
Also, we study the Kunita-type equation Yt = + R t
0 W(dr; Ys), obtaining the local
and global existence and uniqueness of the solution under suitable sufficient conditions.
As an application, we study transport equations with rough vector fields and
observe that the classical solution formula for smooth and Young’s cases does not
provide a solution to the rough equation. Indeed this formula satisfies a transport
equation with additional compensator terms (see (1.7)).

We study a particle system with the following diffusion-branchingselection
mechanism. Particles perform independent one dimensional Brownian motions
and on top of that, at a constant rate, a pair of particles is chosen uniformly at
random and both particles adopt the position of the rightmost one among them. We
show that the cumulative distribution function of the empirical measure converges
to a solution of the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov (F-KPP) equation and
use this fact to prove that the system selects the minimal macroscopic speed as the
number of particles goes to infinity.

We prove that the speed of a -biased random walk on a supercritical
Galton-Watson tree is differentiable for  such that the walk is ballistic and
obeys a central limit theorem, and give an expression of the derivative using a certain
2-dimensional Gaussian random variable. The proof heavily uses the renewal
structure of Galton-Watson trees that was introduced in Lyons et al. (1996).

We investigate the anisotropic stable JCIR process which is a multidimensional
extension of the stable JCIR process but also a multi-dimensional analogue
of the classical JCIR process. We prove that the heat kernel of the anisotropic
stable JCIR process exists and it satisfies an a-priori bound in a weighted anisotropic
Besov norm. Based on this regularity result we deduce the strong Feller property
and prove, for the subcritical case, exponential ergodicity in total variation. Also,
we show that in the one-dimensional case the corresponding heat kernel is smooth.

We investigate the high-dimensional asymptotic distributional behavior
of the components of the f -vector of a random Vietoris-Rips complex that is
generated over a Poisson point process in [1
2 ; 1
2 ]d as the space dimension and the
intensity tend to infinity while the radius parameter tends to zero simultaneously.

We study the local mass of a dyadic branching Brownian motion Z
evolving in Rd. By ‘local mass’, we refer to the number of particles of Z that
fall inside a ball with fixed radius and time-dependent center, lying in the region
where there is typically exponential growth of particles. Using the strong law of
large numbers for the local mass of branching Brownian motion and elementary
geometric arguments, we find large deviation results giving the asymptotic behavior
of the probability that the local mass is atypically small on an exponential scale.
As corollaries, we obtain an asymptotic result for the probability of absence of Z
in a ball with fixed radius and time-dependent center, and lower tail asymptotics
for the local mass in a fixed ball. The proofs are based on a bootstrap argument,
which we use to find the lower tail asymptotics for the mass outside a ball with
time-dependent radius and fixed center, as well.

We establish two equivalent versions of the Darling–Erdos theorem for
Lévy processes in the domain of attraction of a stable process at zero with index  2
(0; 2). In the course of our proofs we obtain a number of maximal and exponential
inequalities for general Lévy processes, which should be of separate interest.

Consider the Ising model on ([1; 2N][1; 2M])\Z2 at critical temperature
with periodic boundary condition in the horizontal direction and free boundary
condition in the vertical direction. Let EM;N be its total energy (or Hamiltonian).
Suppose M is a function of N satisfying M  N=(lnN) for some  2 [0; 1). In
particular, one may take M = N. We prove that
EM;N + 4
p
2MN  (4=)N lnN p
(32=)MN lnN
converges weakly to a standard Gaussian distribution as N ! 1.

We consider a variant of the planted clique problem where we are allowed
unbounded computational time but can only investigate a small part of the
graph by adaptive edge queries. We determine (up to logarithmic factors) the number
of queries necessary both for detecting the presence of a planted clique and for
finding the planted clique.
Specifically, let G ∼ G(n, 1/2, k) be a random graph on n vertices with a planted
clique of size k. We show that no algorithm that makes at most q = o(n2/k2 + n)
adaptive queries to the adjacency matrix of G is likely to find the planted clique.
On the other hand, when k ≥ (2 + ε) log2 n there exists a simple algorithm (with
unbounded computational power) that finds the planted clique with high probability
by making q = O((n2/k2) log2 n + n log n) adaptive queries. For detection,
the additive n term is not necessary: the number of queries needed to detect the
presence of a planted clique is n2/k2 (up to logarithmic factors).

The purpose of this article is to provide a simple proof of the hydrodynamic
and hydrostatic behavior of the SSEP in contact with reservoirs which inject
and remove particles in a finite size windows at the extremities of the bulk. More
precisely, the reservoirs inject/remove particles at/from any point of a window of
size K placed at each extremity of the bulk and particles are injected/removed
to the first open/occupied position in that window. The reservoirs have slow dynamics,
in the sense that they intervene at speed N w.r.t. the bulk dynamics.
In the first part of this article, we treated the case  > 1 for which the entropy
method can be adapted. We treat here the case where the boundary dynamics is
too fast for the Entropy Method to apply. We prove using duality estimates inspired
by previous work that the hydrodynamic limit is given by the heat equation
with Dirichlet boundary conditions, where the density at the boundaries is fixed by
the parameters of the model.

In this paper we are concerned with the two-stage contact process introduced
by Krone (1999) on a high-dimensional lattice. By comparing this process
with an auxiliary model which is a linear system, we obtain two limit theorems for
this process as the dimension of the lattice grows to infinity. The first theorem
is about the upper invariant law of the process. The second theorem is about asymptotic
behavior of the critical value of the process. These two theorems can be
considered as extensions of their counterparts for the basic contact processes proved
by Griffeath (1983) and Schonmann and Vares (1986).

We study the limiting spectral distribution of sample covariance matrices
XXT , where X are p  n random matrices with correlated entries and
p=n ! y 2 [0;1). If y > 0, we obtain the Marcenko–Pastur distribution and
in the case y = 0 the semicircle distribution after appropriate rescaling. The entries
we consider are Curie–Weiss spins, which are correlated random signs, where
the degree of the correlation is governed by an inverse temperature fi > 0. The
model exhibits a phase transition at fi = 1. The correlation between any two entries
is of order O((np)1) for fi 2 (0; 1), O((np)1=2) for fi = 1, and for fi > 1 the
correlation does not vanish in the limit. In our proofs we use Stieltjes transforms
and concentration of random quadratic forms.

We are interested in the survival probability of a population modeled
by a critical branching process in an i.i.d. random environment and in the growth
rate of the population given its survival up to a large time n. We assume that
the random walk associated with the branching process is oscillating and satisfies a
Doney-Spitzer condition P(Sn > 0) ! ; n ! 1, which is a standard condition in
fluctuation theory of random walks. Unlike the previously studied case  2 (0; 1),
we investigate the case where the offspring distribution is in the domain of attraction
of an asymmetric stable law with parameter 1, which implies that  = 0 or 1. We
find the asymptotic behaviour of the survival probability of the population and
prove a Yaglom-type conditional limit theorem for the population size in these two
cases.

For a relatively large class of well-behaved absorbing (or killed) finite
Markov chains, we give detailed quantitative estimates regarding the behavior of the
chain before it is absorbed (or killed). Typical examples are random walks on boxlike
finite subsets of the square lattice Zd absorbed (or killed) at the boundary. The
analysis is based on Poincaré, Nash, and Harnack inequalities, moderate growth,
and on the notions of John and inner-uniform domains.

We study Markov processes conditioned so that their local time must
grow slower than a prescribed function. Building upon recent work on Brownian
motion with constrained local time in Benjamini and Berestycki (2011); Kolb and
Savov (2016), we study transience and recurrence for a broad class of Markov
processes.
In order to understand the local time, we determine the distribution of a nondecreasing
Lévy process (the inverse local time) conditioned to remain above a
given level which varies in time. We study a time-dependent region, in contrast to
previous works in which a process is conditioned to remain in a fixed region (e.g.
Denisov and Wachtel, 2015; Garbit, 2009), so we must study boundary crossing
probabilities for a family of curves, and thus obtain uniform asymptotics for such
a family.
Main results include necessary and sufficient conditions for transience or recurrence
of the conditioned Markov process. We will explicitly determine the distribution
of the inverse local time for the conditioned process, and in the transient
case, we explicitly determine the law of the conditioned Markov process. In the
recurrent case, we characterise the “entropic repulsion envelope” via necessary and
sufficient conditions.

We prove under mild conditions that the Fleming-Viot process selects
the minimal quasi-stationary distribution for Markov processes with soft killing on
non-compact state spaces. Our results are applied to multi-dimensional birth and
death processes, continuous time Galton-Watson processes and diffusion processes
with soft killing.

We study the limiting behavior of an interacting particle system evolving
on the lattice Zd for d  3. The model is known as the contact process with
rapid stirring. The process starts with a single particle at the origin. Each particle
may die, jump to a neighboring site if it is vacant or split. In the case of splitting,
one of the offspring takes the place of the parent while the other, the newborn
particle, is sent to another site in Zd according to a certain distribution; if the
newborn particle lands on an occupied site, its birth is suppressed. We study the
asymptotic behavior of the critical branching rate as the jumping rate (also known
as the stirring rate) approaches infinity.

We present an analogue of the classical Law of Small Numbers, formulated
for the notion of bm-independence, where the random variables are indexed
by elements of positive symmetric cones in Euclidean spaces, including Rd
+, the
Lorentz cone in Minkowski spacetime and positive definite real symmetric matrices.
The geometry of the cones plays a significant role in the study as well as the
combinatorics of bm-ordered partitions.

We consider a family of Bessel Processes that depend on the starting
point x and dimension , but are driven by the same Brownian motion. Our main
result is that almost surely the first time a process hits 0 is jointly continuous in
x and , provided   0. As an application, we show that the SLE() welding
homeomorphism is continuous in  for  2 [0; 4]. Our motivation behind this is to
study the well known problem of the continuity of SLE in . The main tool in our
proofs is random walks with increments distributed as infinite mean Inverse-Gamma
laws.

We introduce and analyze a novel type of coalescent processes called
cross-multiplicative coalescent that models a system with two types of particles,
A and B. The bonds are formed only between the pairs of particles of opposite
types with the same rate for each bond, producing connected components made
of particles of both types. We analyze and solve the Smoluchowski coagulation
system of equations obtained as a hydrodynamic limit of the corresponding Marcus-
Lushnikov process. We establish that the cross-multiplicative kernel is a gelling
kernel, and find the gelation time. As an application, we derive the limiting mean
length of a minimal spanning tree on a complete asymmetric bipartite graph with
independent edge weights, distributed uniformly over [0; 1].

We study the hydrodynamic limit for the isothermal dynamics of an
anharmonic chain under hyperbolic space-time scaling and with nonvanishing viscosity.
The temperature is kept constant by a contact with a heat bath, realised
via a stochastic momentum-preserving noise added to the dynamics. The noise is
designed so it contributes to the macroscopic limit. Dirichlet boundary conditions
are also considered: one end of the chain is kept fixed, while a time-varying tension
is applied to the other end. Moreover, Neumann boundary conditions are added
in such a way that the system produces the correct thermodynamic entropy in the
macroscopic limit. We show that the volume stretch and momentum converge (in
an appropriate sense) to a smooth solution of a system of parabolic conservation
laws (isothermal Navier-Stokes equations in Lagrangian coordinates) with boundary
conditions.
Finally, changing the external tension allows us to define thermodynamic isothermal
transformations between equilibrium states. We use this to deduce the first
and the second law of Thermodynamics for our model.

In this paper, we investigate the fluctuations of a unit eigenvector associated
to an outlier in the spectrum of a spiked N  N complex Deformed Wigner
matrix MN. MN is defined as follows: MN = WN=
p
N + AN where WN is an
N  N Hermitian Wigner matrix whose entries have a law  satisfying a Poincaré
inequality and the matrix AN is a block diagonal matrix, with an eigenvalue  of
multiplicity one, generating an outlier in the spectrum of MN. We prove that the
fluctuations of the norm of the projection of a unit eigenvector corresponding to
the outlier of MN onto a unit eigenvector corresponding to  are not universal.
Indeed, we take away a fit approximation of its limit from this norm and prove the
convergence to zero as N goes to 1 of the Lévy–Prohorov distance between this
rescaled quantity and the convolution of  and a centered Gaussian distribution
(whose variance may depend depend upon N and may not converge).

We investigate the simulation methods for a large family of stable random
fields that appeared in the recent literature, known as the Karlin stable setindexed
processes. We exploit a new representation and implement the procedure
introduced by Asmussen and Rosinski (2001) by first decomposing the random
fields into large-jump and small-jump parts, and simulating each part separately.
As special cases, simulations for several manifold-indexed processes are considered,
and adjustments are introduced accordingly in order to improve the computational
efficiency.

We show existence and uniqueness of solutions of stochastic path dependent
differential equations driven by càdlàg martingale noise under joint local
monotonicity and coercivity assumptions on the coefficients with a bound in terms
of the supremum norm. In this set-up the usual proof using the ordinary Gronwall
lemma together with the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality seems impossible. In
order to solve this problem, we prove a new and quite general stochastic Gronwall
lemma for càdlàg martingales using Lenglart’s inequality.

We analyze the geometrical structure of the passage times in the last
passage percolation model. Viewing the passage time as a piecewise linear function
of the weights we determine the domains of the various pieces, which are the subsets
of the weight space that make a given path the longest one. We focus on the case
when all weights are assumed to be positive, and as a result each domain is a pointed
polyhedral cone. We determine the extreme rays, facets, and two-dimensional faces
of each cone, and also review a well-known simplicial decomposition of the maximal
cones via the so-called order cone. All geometric properties are derived using
arguments phrased in terms of the last passage model itself. Our motivation is to
understand path probabilities of the extremal corner paths on rectangles in Z2, but
all of our arguments apply to general, finite partially ordered sets.

We prove Moderate Deviation estimates for nodal lengths of random
spherical harmonics both on the whole sphere and on shrinking spherical domains.
Central Limit Theorems for the latter were recently established in Marinucci et al.
(2020) and Todino (2020), respectively. Our proofs are based on the combination
of a Moderate Deviation Principle by Schulte and Thäle (2016) for sequences of
random variables living in a fixed Wiener chaos with a well-known result based on
the concept of exponential equivalence

In this paper, we prove a phase transition in the connectivity of finitary
random interlacements FIu;T in Zd, with respect to the average stopping time T.
For each u > 0, with probability one FIu;T has no infinite connected component
for all sufficiently small T > 0, and a unique infinite connected component for all
sufficiently large T < 1. This answers a question of Bowen (2019) in the special
case of Zd.

We consider a class of random loop models (including the random interchange
process) that are parametrised by a time parameter fi  0. Intuitively,
larger fi means more randomness. In particular, at fi = 0 we start with loops of
length 1 and as fi crosses a critical value fic, infinite loops start to occur almost
surely. Our random loop models admit a natural comparison to bond percolation
with p = 1efi on the same graph to obtain a lower bound on fic. For those graphs
of diverging vertex degree where fic and the critical parameter for percolation have
been calculated explicitly, that inequality has been found to be an equality. In
contrast, we show in this paper that for graphs of bounded degree the inequality is
strict, i.e. we show existence of an interval of values of fi where there are no infinite
loops, but infinite percolation clusters almost surely.

Differentiability of semigroups is useful for many applications. Here we
focus on stochastic differential equations whose diffusion coefficient is the square
root of a differentiable function but not differentiable itself. For every m 2 {0, 1, 2}
we establish an upper bound for a Cm-norm of the semigroup of such a diffusion
in terms of the Cm-norms of the drift coefficient and of the squared diffusion coefficient.
The constants in our upper bound are often bounded in the dimension.
Our estimates are thus suitable for analyzing certain high-dimensional and infinitedimensional
degenerate stochastic differential equations.

We study a random graph model in continuous time. Each vertex is
partially copied with the same rate, i.e. an existing vertex is copied and every edge
leading to the copied vertex is copied with independent probability p. In addition,
every edge is deleted at constant rate, a mechanism which extends previous partial
duplication models. In this model, we obtain results on the degree distribution,
which shows a phase transition such that either – if p is small enough – the frequency
of isolated vertices converges to 1, or there is a positive fraction of vertices with
unbounded degree. We derive results on the degrees of the initial vertices as well
as on the sub-graph of non-isolated vertices. In particular, we obtain expressions
for the number of star-like subgraphs and cliques.

Excursion theory is revisited on the ground of Itô–McKean diffusions.
There are raised questions about symmetries, knock-in processes, excursion local
time and the non-linear version of the master formula of excursions. The questions
are answered due to introducing the counting excursion technique. The technique is
a synthesis of straddling at time approach, the classical, potential in spirit approach,
and the theory of convolution algebra of locally integrable functions, generalized
later in this work for the convolutions of –finite measures. Some examples are
presented, including the famous problem of expressing the density of first hitting
time of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in terms of elementary functions.

This work aims to study the dislocation or nodal lines of 3D Berry’s
random waves model. Their expected length is computed both in the isotropic
and anisotropic cases, being them compared. Afterwards, in the isotropic case
the asymptotic variance and distribution of the length are studied as the domain
grows to the whole space. We find different orders of magnitude for the variance
and different limit distributions for different submodels. The study includes the
Berry’s monochromatic random waves, the Bargmann-Fock model and the Black-
Body radiation.

We consider models for count variables with a GARCH-type structure.
Such a process consists of an integer-valued component and a volatility process. Using
arguments for contractive Markov chains we prove that this bivariate process has
a unique stationary regime. Furthermore, we show absolute regularity (fi-mixing)
with geometrically decaying coefficients for the count process. These probabilistic
results are complemented by a statistical analysis and a few simulations.

We consider the discrete-time voter model on complete bipartite graphs
and study the quasi-stationary distribution (QSD) for the model as the size of one
of the partitions tends to infinity while the other partition remains fixed. We show
that the QSDs converge weakly to a nontrivial limit which features a consensus with
the exception of a random number of dissenting vertices in the “large” partition.
Moreover, we explicitly calculate the law of the number of dissenters and show
that it follows the heavy-tailed Sibuya distribution with parameter depending on
the size of the “small” partition. Our results rely on a discrete-time analogue of
the well-known duality between the continuous-time voter model and coalescing
random walks which we develop in the paper.

In this paper we consider the Glauber dynamics for the one-dimensional
Ising model with dissipation, in a mesoscopic regime obtained by letting inverse
temperature and volume go to infinity with a suitable scaling. In this limit the
magnetization has a periodic behavior. Self-organized collective periodicity has
been shown for many mean-field models but, to our knowledge, this is the first
example with short-range interaction. This supports the view that self-organized
periodicity is not linked with the mean-field assumption but it is a thermodynamic
phenomenon compatible with short range interactions.

This article deals with the emergence of a specific mating preference
pattern called homogamy in a population. Individuals are characterized by their
genotype at two haploid loci, and the population dynamics is modelled by a nonlinear
birth-and-death process. The first locus codes for a phenotype, while the
second locus codes for homogamy defined with respect to the first locus: two individuals
are more (resp. less) likely to reproduce with each other if they carry the
same (resp. a different) trait at the first locus. Initial resident individuals do not
feature homogamy, and we are interested in the probability and time of invasion
of a mutant presenting this characteristic under a large population assumption.
To this aim, we study the trajectory of the birth-and-death process during three
phases: growth of the mutant, coexistence of the two types, and extinction of the
resident. We couple the birth-and-death process with simpler processes, like multidimensional
branching processes or dynamical systems, and study the latter ones
in order to control the trajectory and duration of each phase.

In this article we consider transient random walks on HNN extensions
of finitely generated groups. We prove that the rate of escape w.r.t. some generalised
word length exists. Moreover, a central limit theorem with respect to the
generalised word length is derived. Finally, we show that the rate of escape, which
can be regarded as a function in the finitely many parameters which describe the
random walk, behaves as a real-analytic function in terms of probability measures
of constant support.

It has been a puzzling question of why sexual reproduction has been so
successful. Fisher and Muller hypothesized that reproducing by sex can speed up
evolution; recombination could combine beneficial alleles on different chromosomes
and speeds up the time that the beneficial alleles become fixated population. We
consider a population of 2N chromosomes and focus on two loci on these chromosomes.
The allele at each locus can mutate to a beneficial allele at rate N.
Chromosomes with 0, 1, and 2 beneficial alleles die at rates 1; 1sN, and 12sN,
respectively, and they are replaced immediately after death events. With probability
1  rN, the replacement inherits both alleles from one parent chosen at
random from the population at the time of replacement. With probability rN, recombination
occurs, and the replacement receives its two alleles from two randomly
chosen parents. Under certain assumptions on the parameters N; N; sN; and rN,
we obtain an asymptotic approximation to the time that both beneficial alleles are
fixated in the population. When the recombination probability is small, recombination
does not speed up the time that the two beneficial alleles become fixated. In
contrast, when the recombination probability is significant, recombination shorten
this time. The result agrees with the Fisher-Muller hypothesis and confirms the
advantage of reproducing by sex.

We consider families of equivalent probability measures Q with a property
related to concepts known in the literature under different names such as
rectangularity or multiplicative stability. For the problems considered in this paper
such a property yields dynamical consistency. We prove under a weak-compactness
assumption with general filtrations and continuous processes that all semimartingales
have an additive decomposition as the sum of a predictable non-decreasing
process and a universal local supermartingale, by this concept we mean a process
that is a local supermartingale with respect to each element of Q. We also
show that processes having a supermartingale property with respect to a superadditive
nonlinear conditional expectation associated to the family Q are always
semimartingales under weak-compactness. These results are relevant in stochastic
optimization problems including optimal stopping under model ambiguity.

The paper has four goals. First, we want to generalize the classical
concept of the branching property so that it becomes true for historical and genealogical
processes, where the classical concept fails (here we use the description
of genealogies by (V -marked) ultrametric measure spaces leading to state spaces
U resp. UV ). In particular we want to complement the corresponding concept of
infinite divisibility developed in Glöde et al. (2019) for this context. The processes
we consider are always defined by well-posed martingale problems. The point of
the generalized branching property is that the state at times t+s can at any time t
be decomposed in a measurable function of the state at time t and an independent
part which itself then decomposes in independent copies of the process evolving for
time s. Secondly we want to find a corresponding characterization of the generators
of branching processes both easy to apply and general enough to cover a wide range
of mechanisms and state spaces, this is our first main result.
As a third goal we want to obtain the branching property for some important
examples as the U-valued Feller diffusion respectively UV -valued super random
walk and the historical process on countable geographic spaces, the latter as two
examples of a whole zoo of spatial processes we could treat. The fourth goal is to
show the robustness of the method and to get the generalized branching property for
genealogies marked with ancestral path, giving the line of descent moving through
the ancestors and space, leading to path-marked ultrametric measure spaces. These
new processes are constructed here and proved to have the generalized branching
property, both together our second major result.
We develop an abstract framework covering above situations and questions, leading
to a new generator criterion. The state spaces suitable for historical and genealogical
processes are consistent collections of topological semigroups each enriched
with a compatible collection of maps, the truncation maps. All objects are
defined on the state space of the process. The method allows to treat every type of
population model formulated as solution to a well-posed martingale problem. This
framework in particular includes processes taking values in the space of marked
ultrametric measure spaces and hence allows to treat historical information and
genealogies of spatial population models both at once, if genealogies are described
this way. Another example is a multitype population, more specific with genetic
types under mutation.

We study a class of models of i.i.d. random environments in general
dimensions d  2, where each site is equipped randomly with an environment,
and a parameter p governs the frequency of certain environments that can act as
a barrier. We show that many of these models (including some which are nonmonotone
in p) exhibit a phase transition for the geometry of connected clusters as
p varies.

We prove sharp two-sided estimates on the tail probability of the first
hitting time of bounded interval as well as its asymptotic behaviour for general
non-symmetric processes which satisfy an integral condition
To this end, we first prove and then apply the global scale invariant Harnack inequality.
Results are obtained under certain conditions on the characteristic exponent.
We provide a wide class of Lévy processes which satisfy these assumptions.

We consider a doubly reflected backward stochastic differential equations
with jumps and two completely separated optional barriers in a general filtration
that supports a one-dimensional Brownian motion and an independent Poisson
random measure. We suppose that the barriers have trajectories with left and right
finite limits. We provide the existence and uniqueness result when the coefficient
is stochastic Lipschitz by using a penalization method.

In this paper, we consider U-statistics whose data is a strictly stationary
sequence which can be expressed as a functional of an i.i.d. one. We establish a
strong law of large numbers, a bounded law of the iterated logarithms and a central
limit theorem under a dependence condition. The main ingredients for the proof
are an approximation by U-statistics whose data is a functional of ` i.i.d. random
variables and an analogue of the Hoeffding’s decomposition for U-statistics of this
type.

We prove a formula for the speed of distance–stationary random sequences
generalizing the law of large numbers of Karlsson and Ledrappier. A particular
case is the classical formula for the largest Lyapunov exponent of i.i.d. matrix
products, but our result has applications in various different contexts. In many situations
it gives a method to estimate the speed, and in others it allows to obtain
results of dimension drop for escape measures related to random walks. We show applications
to stationary reversible random trees with conductances, Bernoulli bond
percolation of Cayley graphs, and random walks on cocompact Fuchsian groups.

We consider a generic modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality (mLSI)
of the form for some difference operator , and show how
it implies two-level concentration inequalities akin to the Hanson–Wright or Bernstein
inequality. This can be applied to the continuous (e. g. the sphere or bounded
perturbations of product measures) as well as discrete setting (the symmetric group,
finite measures satisfying an approximate tensorization property, . . . ).
Moreover, we use modified logarithmic Sobolev inequalities on the symmetric
group Sn and for slices of the hypercube to prove Talagrand’s convex distance
inequality, and provide concentration inequalities for locally Lipschitz functions on
Sn. Some examples of known statistics are worked out, for which we obtain the
correct order of fluctuations, which is consistent with central limit theorems.

In this note, we studied the asymptotic behaviour of the length of the
longest common substring for run-length encoded sequences. When the original
sequences are generated by an -mixing process with exponential decay (or  -
mixing with polynomial decay), we proved that this length grows logarithmically
with a coefficient depending on the Rényi entropy of the pushforward measure. For
Bernoulli processes and Markov chains, this coefficient is computed explicitly.

In this paper, we study spatial averages for the parabolic Anderson
model in the Skorohod sense driven by rough Gaussian noise, which is colored in
space and time. We include the case of a fractional noise with Hurst parameters H0
in time and H1 in space, satisfying H0 2 (1=2; 1), H1 2 (0; 1=2) and H0+H1 > 3=4.
Our main result is a functional central limit theorem for the spatial averages. As
an important ingredient of our analysis, we present a Feynman-Kac formula that is
new for these values of the Hurst parameters.

Annealed functional CLT in the rough path topology is proved for the
standard class of ballistic random walks in random environment. Moreover, the
‘area anomaly’, i.e. a deterministic linear correction for the second level iterated
integral of the rescaled path, is identified in terms of a stochastic area on a regeneration
interval. The main theorem is formulated in more general settings, namely for
any discrete process with uniformly bounded increments which admits a regeneration
structure where the regeneration times have finite moments. Here the largest
finite moment translates into the degree of regularity of the rough path topology.
In particular, the convergence holds in the -Hölder rough path topology for all
 < 1=2 whenever all moments are finite, which is the case for the class of ballistic
random walks in random environment. The latter may be compared to a special
class of random walks in Dirichlet environments for which the regularity  < 1=2 is
bounded away from 1=2, explicitly in terms of the corresponding trap parameter.

In this paper we consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) fixed point
(ht ; t  0) (Corwin et al., 2015; Matetski et al., 2016) and prove that, for suitable
initial conditions, ht(x)  ht(0) converges to a two-sided Brownian motion with
zero drift and diffusion coefficient 2, as t ! 1. The heart of the proof is the
coupling method, that allows us to compare the TASEP height function started
from a perturbation of density 1=2 with its invariant counterpart which, under
KPZ scaling, turns into uniform estimates for the KPZ fixed point.

We consider a random walk on the hyperoctahedral group Bn generated
by the signed permutations of the forms (i; n) and (i; n) for 1  i  n. We call
this the flip-transpose top with random shuffle on Bn. We find the spectrum of
the transition probability matrix for this shuffle. We prove that the mixing time
for this shuffle is of order n log n. We also show that this shuffle exhibits the
cutoff phenomenon. In the appendix, we show that a similar random walk on the
demihyperoctahedral group Dn also has a cutoff at
We fix d  2 and denote S the semi-group of d  d matrices with non
negative entries. We consider a sequence (An;Bn)n1 of i.i.d. random variables
with values in S  Rd
+ and study the asymptotic behavior of the Markov chain
(Xn)n0 on Rd
+ defined by:
8n  0; Xn+1 = An+1Xn + Bn+1;
where X0 is a fixed random variable. We assume that the Lyapunov exponent of
the matrices An equals 0 and prove, under quite general hypotheses, that there
exists up to a multiplicative constant a unique Radon measure m on (R+)d which
is invariant for the chain (Xn)n0; furthermore, this measure m is infinite. The
existence of m relies on a recent work by T.D.C. Pham about fluctuations of the
norm of product of random matrices (Pham, 2018). Its unicity is a consequence
of a general property, called “local contractivity”, highlighted about 20 years ago
by M. Babillot, Ph. Bougerol et L. Elie in the case of the one dimensional affine
recursion (Babillot et al., 1997).

We propose a new powerful family of tests of univariate normality. These tests are
based on an initial value problem in the space of characteristic functions originating from the fixed
point property of the normal distribution in the zero bias transform. Limit distributions of the test
statistics are provided under the null hypothesis, as well as under contiguous and fixed alternatives.
Using the covariance structure of the limiting Gaussian process from the null distribution, we derive
explicit formulas for the first four cumulants of the limiting random element and apply the results
by fitting a distribution from the Pearson system. A comparative Monte Carlo power study shows
that the new tests are serious competitors to the strongest well established tests.

In this short note, we extend the celebrated results of Tao and Vu, and Krishnapur
on the universality of empirical spectral distributions to a wide class of inhomogeneous complex
random matrices, by showing that a technical and hard-to-verify Fourier domination assumption
may be replaced simply by a natural uniform anti-concentration assumption.
Along the way, we show that inhomogeneous complex random matrices, whose expected squared
Hilbert-Schmidt norm is quadratic in the dimension, and whose entries (after symmetrization) are
uniformly anti-concentrated at 0 and infinity, typically have smallest singular value 
(n1=2). The
rate n1=2 is sharp, and closes a gap in the literature.
Our proofs closely follow recent works of Livshyts, and Livshyts, Tikhomirov, and Vershynin on
inhomogeneous real random matrices. The new ingredient is an anti-concentration inequality for
sums of independent, but not necessarily identically distributed, complex random variables, which
may also be useful in other contexts.

We prove the existence of non-trivial phase transitions for the intersection of two independent
random interlacements and the complement of the intersection. Some asymptotic results
about the phase curves are also obtained. Moreover, we show that at least one of these two sets
percolates in high dimensions.

In this article we give a direct proof of a central limit theorem and law of large numbers
for a functional with compact support of a diffusion. Some applications are given in order to obtain
a parameter estimation for different models.

In 2013 A.A. Borovkov and A.A. Mogulskii proved a weaker-than-standard “metric” large
deviations principle (LDP) for trajectories of random walks in Rd whose increments have the Laplace
transform finite in a neighbourhood of zero. We prove that general metric LDPs are preserved under
uniformly continuous mappings. This allows us to transform the result of Borovkov and Mogulskii
into standard LDPs. We also give an explicit integral representation of the rate function they found.
As an application, we extend the classical Cramér theorem by proving an LPD for kernel-weighted
sums of i.i.d. random vectors in Rd.

Benatar and Maffucci (2019) established an asymptotic law for the variance of the
nodal surface of arithmetic random waves on the 3-torus in the high-energy limit. In a subsequent
work, Cammarota (2019) proved a universal non-Gaussian limit theorem for the nodal surface.
In this paper, we study the nodal intersection length and the number of nodal intersection points
associated, respectively, with two and three independent arithmetic random waves of same frequency
on the 3-torus. For these quantities, we compute their expected value, asymptotic variance as well
as their limiting distribution. Our results are based on Wiener-Itô expansions for the volume and
naturally complement the findings of Cammarota (2019). At the core of our analysis lies an abstract
cancellation phenomenon applicable to the study of level sets of arbitrary Gaussian random fields,
that we believe has independent interest.

Exchangeable coalescents with dust are studied. The rate of convergence as the sample
size tends to infinity of the scaled block counting process to the frequency of singleton process
is determined. This rate is expressed in terms of a certain Bernstein function. The proofs are
based on Taylor expansions of the infinitesimal generators and semigroups and involve a particular
concentration inequality arising in the context of Karlin’s infinite urn model. The rate of convergence
is calculated for several examples of coalescents.

In this paper we investigate the local limit theorem for additive functionals of a nonstationary
Markov chain with finite or infinite second moment. The moment conditions are imposed
on the individual summands and the weak dependence structure is expressed in terms of some
uniformly mixing coefficients.

In this paper, we introduce and study a convoluted version of the time fractional Poisson
process by taking the discrete convolution with respect to space variable in the system of fractional
differential equations that governs its state probabilities. We call the introduced process as the
convoluted fractional Poisson process (CFPP). It has integer valued jumps of size j  1. The
explicit expression for the Laplace transform of its state probabilities are obtained whose inversion
yields its one-dimensional distribution. A special case of the CFPP, namely, the convoluted Poisson
process (CPP) is studied and its time-changed subordination relationships with CFPP are discussed.
It is shown that the CPP is a Lévy process using which the long-range dependence property of CFPP
is established. Moreover, we show that the increments of CFPP exhibits short-range dependence
property.

In this work we introduce a theory of stochastic integration for operator-valued integrands
with respect to some classes of cylindrical martingale-valued measures in Hilbert spaces.
The integral is constructed via the radonification of cylindrical martingales by a Hilbert-Schmidt
operator theorem and unifies several other theories of stochastic integration in Hilbert spaces. In
particular, our theory covers the theory of stochastic integration with respect to a Hilbert space
valued Lévy process with second moments, with respect to a cylindrical Lévy processes with (weak)
second moments and with respect to a Lévy-valued random martingale measures with finite second
moment. As an application of our theory of integration we prove existence and uniqueness
of solutions for stochastic stochastic partial differential equations driven by multiplicative cylindrical
martingale-valued measure noise with rather general coefficients. Existence and uniqueness of
solutions in the presence of multiplicative Lévy noise (with no moments assumptions) is also proved.

Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold with smooth boundary. We obtain the exact
long time asymptotic behaviour of heat kernels on abelian covering spaces of M with mixed Dirichlet
and Neumann boundary conditions. As an application, we study the long time behaviour of the
winding number of reflected Brownian motion in M. In particular, we establish a Gaussian type
central limit theorem showing that when rescaled appropriately, the fluctuation of the winding
number is asymptotically Gaussian with an explicit covariance matrix.

We extend the general stochastic matching model on graphs introduced in Mairesse and
Moyal (2016), to matching models on multigraphs, that is, graphs with self-loops. The evolution of
the model can be described by a discrete time Markov chain whose positive recurrence is investigated.
Necessary and sufficient stability conditions are provided, together with the explicit form of the
stationary probability in the case where the matching policy is ‘First Come, First Matched’.

Distance covariance is a measure of dependence between two random variables that take
values in two, in general different, metric spaces, see Székely et al. (2007) and Lyons (2013). It is
known that the distance covariance, and its generalization -distance covariance, can be defined
in several different ways that are equivalent under some moment conditions. The present paper
considers four such definitions and find minimal moment conditions for each of them, together with
some partial results when these conditions are not satisfied.
Another purpose of the present paper is to improve existing results on consistency of distance
covariance, estimated using the empirical distribution of a sample.
The paper also studies the special case when the variables are Hilbert space valued, and shows
under weak moment conditions that two such variables are independent if and only if their (-)
distance covariance is 0; this extends results by Lyons (2013) and Dehling et al. (2020). The proof
uses a new definition of distance covariance in the Hilbert space case, generalizing the definition for
Euclidean spaces using characteristic functions by Székely et al. (2007).

We propose a new definition of the interface in the context of the Bernoulli percolation
model. We construct a coupling between two percolation configurations, one which is a standard
percolation configuration, and one which is a percolation configuration conditioned on a disconnection
event. We define the interface as the random set of the edges where these two configurations
differ. We prove that, inside a cubic box , the interface between the top and the bottom of the
box is typically localised within a distance of order (ln jj)2 of the set of the pivotal edges.

Consider random d-regular graphs, i.e., random graphs such that there are exactly d
edges from each vertex for some d  3. We study both the configuration model version of this
graph, which has occasional multi-edges and self-loops, as well as the simple version of it, which is
a d-regular graph chosen uniformly at random from the collection of all d-regular graphs.
In this paper, we discuss mixing times of Glauber dynamics for the Ising model with an external
magnetic field on a random d-regular graph, both in the quenched as well as the annealed settings.
Let fi be the inverse temperature, fic be the critical temperature and B be the external magnetic
field. Concerning the annealed measure, we show that for fi > fic there exists ^Bc(fi) 2 (0;1) such
that the model is metastable (i.e., the mixing time is exponential in the graph size n) when fi > fic
and 0  B < ^Bc(fi), whereas it exhibits the cut-off phenomenon at c?n log n with a window of order
n when fi < fic or fi > fic and B > ^Bc(fi). Interestingly, ^Bc(fi) coincides with the critical external
field of the Ising model on the d-ary tree (namely, above which the model has a unique Gibbs
measure). Concerning the quenched measure, we show that there exists Bc(fi) with Bc(fi)  ^Bc(fi)
such that for fi > fic, the mixing time is at least exponential along some subsequence (nk)k1 when
0  B < Bc(fi), whereas it is less than or equal to Cn log n when B > ^Bc(fi). The quenched results
also hold for the model conditioned on simplicity, for the annealed results this is unclear.

We derive explicit formulas for the two first moments of the site frequency spectrum
(SFSn;b)1bn1 of the Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent along with some precise and efficient approximations,
even for small sample sizes n. These results provide new L2-asymptotics for some
values of b = o(n). We also study the length of internal branches carrying b > n=2 individuals,
we provide their joint distribution function as well as a convergence in law for their marginal distribution.
Our results rely on the random recursive tree construction of the Bolthausen-Sznitman
coalescent.

We consider a modified version of the biased random walk on a tree constructed from
the set of finite self-avoiding walks on the hexagonal lattice, and use it to construct probability
measures on infinite self-avoiding walk. Under theses probability measures, we prove that the
infinite self-avoiding walks have the Russo-Seymour-Welsh property of the exploration curve of the
critical Bernoulli percolation.

We prove a law of large numbers for the order and size of the largest strongly connected
component in the directed configuration model. Our result extends previous work by Cooper and
Frieze (2004).

In this paper we prove that the stationary harmonic measure of an infinite set in the
upper planar lattice can be represented as the proper scaling limit of the classical harmonic measure
of truncations of the infinite set.

This paper analyzes the question of where one should stand when playing darts. If one
stands at distance d > 0 and aims at a 2 Rn, then the dart (modelled by a random vector X in
Rn) hits a random point given by a + dX. Next, given a payoff function f, one considers
sup
a
Ef(a + dX)
and asks if this is decreasing in d; i.e., whether it is better to stand closer rather than farther from
the target. Perhaps surprisingly, this is not always the case and understanding when this does or
does not occur is the purpose of this paper.
We show that if X has a so-called selfdecomposable distribution, then it is always better to stand
closer for any payoff function. This class includes all stable distributions as well as many more.
On the other hand, if the payoff function is cos(x), then it is always better to stand closer if and
only if the characteristic function jX(t)j is decreasing on [0;1). We will then show that if there
are at least two point masses, then it is not always better to stand closer using cos(x). If there is a
single point mass, one can find a different payoff function to obtain this phenomenon.
Another large class of darts X for which there are bounded continuous payoff functions for which
it is not always better to stand closer are distributions with compact support. This will be obtained
by using the fact that the Fourier transform of such distributions has a zero in the complex plane.
This argument will work whenever there is a complex zero of the Fourier transform.
Finally, we analyze if the property of it being better to stand closer is closed under convolution
and/or limits.

We develop the complex-analytic viewpoint on the tree convolutions studied by the second
author and Weihua Liu in Jekel and Liu (2020), which generalize the free, boolean, monotone,
and orthogonal convolutions. In particular, for each rooted subtree T of the N-regular tree (with
vertices labeled by alternating strings), we define the convolution T (1; : : : ; N) for arbitrary
probability measures 1, . . . , N on R using a certain fixed-point equation for the Cauchy transforms.
The convolution operations respect the operad structure of the tree operad from Jekel and
Liu (2020). We prove a general limit theorem for iterated T -free convolution similar to Bercovici
and Pata’s results in the free case Bercovici and Pata (1999), and we deduce limit theorems for
measures in the domain of attraction of each of the classical stable laws.

In this paper we consider universal nonparametric estimators for the conditional expectations
of the output of a stationary process at carefully selected time instances (intermittent
estimation). These estimators are based on the information provided by the random outputs at
past times. Pointwise consistency, integrability of various suprema and asymptotic normality will
be established for these nonparametric intermittent estimators.

We give a general criterion for the Dirichlet problem at infinity (DPI) on a Cartan-
Hadamard surface to be solvable, which we primarily use to give the best possible upper radial radial
curvature bound for solvability of the DPI, but which is also flexible enough to accommodate flats.
In particular, any (upper) radial curvature bound which implies transience also implies solvability of
the DPI, which is perhaps surprising. Taking advantage of the structure provided by uniformization,
we show that solvability of the DPI implies there is a natural continuous surjection of the Martin
boundary onto the geometric boundary at infinity. Finally, we give matched upper and lower radial
curvature bounds that imply the natural identification of the geometric and Martin boundaries (for
Cartan-Hadamard surfaces) that are more generous than the bounds that are known in arbitrary
dimension.

We prove convergence of the full extremal process of the scale-inhomogeneous discrete
Gaussian free field in dimension two in the weak correlation regime. The scale-inhomogeneous
discrete Gaussian free field is obtained from the 2d discrete Gaussian free field by modifying the
variance through a function I : [0; 1] ! [0; 1]. The full extremal process converges to a cluster Cox
process. The random intensity of the Cox process depends on I0(0) through a random measure Y
and on I0(1) through a constant fi. We show that, in law, the random measure, Y , is equal to the
Liouville Quantum Gravity measure at sub-critical temperature  = 2(0). The cluster process,
which only depends on I0(1), can be described as atoms of a standard 2d discrete Gaussian free
field conditioned to be unusually high.

We consider a nearest neighbour random walk on the integers with absorption at 0 and
constant jump probabilities to the left and right of zero. The associated spectral radius is  and
the spatial -Martin exit boundary comprises two extremal points and associated minimal excessive
functions h1 and h+1 associated with sequences xn converging to 1 and +1 respectively. We
construct a space-time sequence (xn; n) with xn ! 1 converging to a point in the space-time
-Martin exit boundary whose associated space time harmonic function h(x; t) is minimal and of
the form th+1(x) not th1(x) as might have been hoped.
